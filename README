This merely reduces horizontal spacing between notification icons.

It essentially lets you modify .panel-button's -natural-padding attribute (default 12px, changed to 6px by default).

To modify it edit 'stylesheet.js' and change the line:

    -natural-hpadding: 6px;

to whatever spacing you want. The original GNOME-shell value is 12px, and the default for this plugin is 6px.

If you reduce it to less than 6px (it looks kind of funny then) you will also have to change the line:

    -minimum-hpadding: 6px; 

to be the same.


Alternatively, you can just modify /usr/share/gnome-shell/theme/gnome-shell.css
 and change the lines there...
